Web-based Blood Donation Management System is a management system website that
enables individuals who want to donate blood to help the needy. It also enables hospitals
to record and store the data for people who want to communicate with them, and it also
provides a centralized blood bank database. The system is developed by using HTML,
PHP, and MySQL as a database system to manage and store the data. The Waterfall
Methodology, which is the traditional version and the classic approach of a system
development life cycle, is used to develop and build the web-based blood bank. The
system targets three types of user: the public who wants to donate blood, the recipients
who need the donated blood, and the hospitals who that work as an intermediary to
manage the communication between the donors and recipients. The main objectives for
developing the website is to educate the community on the benefits of blood donation,
develop a Web-Based Blood Bank System to manage the records of donors and
recipients, and encourage voluntary blood donation, easily accessing any information
about blood type and the distribution of the blood in various hospitals in Jeddah, based
on the hospital needs.
